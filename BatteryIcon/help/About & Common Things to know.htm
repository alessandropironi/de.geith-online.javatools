<h1>Things you need to know about The Battery Icon Creator</h1>
<p>This is a small tutorial for the Battery Icon Creator. </p>
<h2>Things you need to keep in mind!</h2>
<h4>1. Settings for each battery style</h4>
<p>This programm is an App that has grown a lott. First it was -as the name 
says- only an editor for battery icons. Every battery style had and still has 
its own set of settings. Even the &quot;No Batt Icons&quot; style. When the App grew up...the 
settings were growing too with all that stuff you need for Wifi and Signal icons 
filenames for lockhandle and so on. All this is stored within the settings of 
the chosen battery style.</p>
<p>The consequence is, if you choose another battery style, you have to do your 
adjustments for wifi and so on again. Most important you have to set your Rom 
presets again for the new battery style! Don't forget that, or you might end up 
with a flashable zip that does nothing but adding icons to systemui and 
framework-res in the wrong drawable folder!!!</p>
<p>The pro on this is: </p>
<ul>
  <li>You can store all settings in one file, </li>
  <li>you can even restore settings from for example ArcBattery to AOKP battery 
  and all your colorsettings are the same</li>
</ul>
<p>What is not stored in settings is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what kind of Wifi style or signal style you chose</li>
  <li>what weather iconset you chose</li>
  <li>what lockhandle you chose</li>
  <li>what toggles you chose</li>
  <li>how transparent your notification area should be</li>
  <li>what charge icon you chose (this might be stored in some future 
  Version..ist mor or less a low prio bug ;-))</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. No xml modding by this App</h4>
<p>This tool dos not mod any xml files within your roms apk's! It most likely 
will never do this!<br>
The only thing it does is replacing png's!</p>
<p>This makes all your flashable zips compatible for every version or 
incarnation of your rom! No need to create a new zip for every nightly of your 
rom. As long as the dev of you rom does not change from lets say xhdpi to hdpi 
the mods will be compatible &quot;forever&quot;. The will even work on other roms with 
same dpi!</p>
<h4>3. A 1% battery mod must be in your rom</h4>
<p>Your rom needs to have a 1% battery mod to be compatible. The tool creates 
204 png's for the 1% battery. 0 to 100% for charging and discharging and 2 &quot;full&quot; 
icons. The rom will then show the png corresponding to the battery level.</p>
<p>All AOKP have a battery circle mod (find it in Rom Control --&gt; Battery) This 
is what my tool will use and replace the 204 icons for it.</p>
<p>Stock roms normally don't have a 1% mod unless you install a mod like JKay! 
Attention the pngs for JKay are named slightly different then the ones in AOKP. 
You can choose the right names with the Rom-Presets.</p>
<p>Until late oktober 2012 CM10 did not have a 1% mod. So it is not compatible. 
Since then they have a circle battery mod to, <b>but this is very different,</b> 
as it has no 204 png's. It renders the icon online with a grafical algorithm 
like my tool does. Perhaps it will later have different online renderred battery 
styles...who knows...there definately is potential!</p>
