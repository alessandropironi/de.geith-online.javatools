This is for all of you who don't have a 1%-Mod in SystemUI.apk
###############################################################
The above 2 XML's add a 1% battery-mod to SystemUI.apk.
##########
Attention! Read carefully!: 
##########
You need to flash battery icons along with this mod! 
To do this you have to do some research!

- Pull the SystemUI.apk from your phone.
- Open it/Extract it to some folder with a tool like 7Zip!
- look into the extracted /res/drawable folder....
- check if you find the 2 XML's provided here...your's will be (must be) replaced with mine!
- if you don't have those xml's ...stop reading here and ask for help on XDA :-)
- then find the drawable folder, where your normal battery icons are
  - /res/drawable-hdpi or /res/drawable-xhdpi
  - remember where you found them
  - remember the size (height) ot those icons
  - choose/apply this Rom-Preset: "Presets for 1%Mod from(XML-Sets)" (sets the correct filenames for battery-PNGs)
  - and set the drawable correct in "Rom Settings"
  - and set the battery size accordingly
  - Save your Rom Settings!
  - then create your battery icons in the battery-tab! 
- create your zip with this XML's and the batteries you just created.

If this worked, you don't need to flash these XML's again (unless your Rom gets updated to a new Version)!
After that you can just flash different battery-Icons. Make sure you use the Rom-Settings from above! (Save them!)
