[SIZE="6"][B][CENTER]I proudly present my new Battery Icon Creator[/CENTER][/B][/SIZE]

[SIZE="4"][B]History or why did I develop this tool?:[/B][/SIZE]
I was fed up, with designing my battery icons with a painttool. 204 icons per set is a lot work, if you do it manually!
As I mostly did abstract and simple icons to be in harmony with AOKP, I had the idea, to develop a little Java tool to do the work for me ;)
Now it has grown up and much more was added. (I should think about a new Name? :)) 
You can mod many aspects of the statusbar and notification Area now!

[SIZE="4"][B]HowTo - General[/B][/SIZE]
This tool is written in pure Java. So the only thing you need to have is a Java Runtime 1.6 or 1.7.
[LIST]
[*]Download the zip attached to this Post
[*]Unzip the tool to any directory
[*]Step into that directory
[*]Doubleclick in the Jar-file
[*]...or use the start.bat
[*]Choose Design (Combobox in Buttonbar)
[*]Choose your ROM's dpi (RR 2.7 is hdpi, RR 3.x.x is xhdpi)
[*]Create your images (Play-Button)
[*]...play with resize-option and algorithm to get best results
[*]...the Tool will create a new folder "pngs" in the above directory
[*]...find your Icons in there...
[*]Or (when you are satisfied with your settings) create a flashable Zip (Button next to Playbutton)
[*]...find the Zip in the "flashablezip_out"-folder
[/LIST]

[SIZE="4"][B]HowTo - Is my ROM supported?[/B][/SIZE]
For a Rom to be supported, it needs to have a 1% battery mod!
Samsung Stock Roms don't have this until a Mod like JKay is applied.
CM10 Roms like the official nightlies or Paranoidandroid don't have this either. 
I am sure there are some Mod's out there that will do the trick with these Roms...

If your ROM has a 1% Mod, there are only a few things you need to investigate, to find the correct Settings for my tool.
You need to...
[LIST]
[*]extract the SystemUI.apk from your Rom (look in the flashabel zip of your Rom, 
[*}or use your phone and navigate with EsExplorer or Root-Explorer to /system/app and find SystemUI.apk there and 
[*]...copy it to your internal or external SD card, so you can access the file from your Computer
[*]Open SystemUI.apk with 7Zip and navigate to ...
[*]...res\drawable-<xxxx> and find the rom's original 1% battery icons in there
[*]remember the folder you found your png's in. (normally [B]drawable-hdpi or drawable-xhdpi[/B])
[*]see how the Files are named. (something like [B]stat_sys_battery_circle_charge_anim<percentage>.png[/B])
[*]check the hight of the original png's
[*]now you got everything to choose the correct settings in the Battery Icon Creator
[*]...drawable-Folder
[*]...naming convention/pattern of png's
[*]...icon height
[/LIST]
If you found your settings, please let me know, what settings, what ROM you used. 
So I can add the ROM to my compatibility list and add predefined Settings to the tool itself.

[SIZE="4"][B]HowTo - Toggles...your own, custom toggles[/B][/SIZE]
[LIST]
[*]Same procedure as above to analyse SystemUI.apk 
[*}...find the toggle icons in there 
[*]...copy toggles into a new folder under ./custom/toggles/<setname> 
[*]......eg ./custom/toggles/MySuperDuperToggles
[*]......next to my predifined Togglesets!
[*]Hint: it might be a good idea to create another folder in there with the untouched original toggle icons from your Rom's SystemUI.apk
[*]......eg ./custom/toggles/MyOriginalToggles
[*]...for AOKP Roms there are normally 36 icons named like toggle_*.png
[*]...edit the toggles with some Paint-Tool ore replace them with some completely new toggles(maybe you downloaded some from the internet)
[*]...make sure you have the correct filenames of your toggles (filenames need to be exactly like in your SystemUI.apk)
[*]Start The Battery Icon Creator and find your Toggleset in the Dropdownbox there...
[*]choose your Toggleset and create your flaschable zip 
[/LIST]

I am not responsible, if you brick your device...this is just a tool, you need to do the thinking ;)
