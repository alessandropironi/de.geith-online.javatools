[SIZE="6"][B][CENTER]I proudly present my new Battery Icon Creator[/CENTER][/B][/SIZE]

[SIZE="4"][B]History:[/B][/SIZE]
I was fed up, with designing my battery-icons with a paint-tool. 204 icons per set is a lot work, if you do it manually!
As I mostly did abstract and simple icons to be in harmony with AOKP, I had the idea, to develop a little Java Tool to do the work for me ;)

So here it comes....
