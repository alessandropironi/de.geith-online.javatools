[SIZE="6"][B][CENTER]I proudly present my new Battery Icon Creator[/CENTER][/B][/SIZE]

[B]History:[/B]
I was fed up, with designing my battery-icons with a paint-tool. 204 icons per set is a lot work, if you do it manually!
As I mostly did abstract and simple icons to be in harmony with AOKP, I had the idea, to develop a little Java Tool to do the work for me ;)

So here it comes....

[B]Features:[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Seven highly customizable Styles (more to come...ideas welcome ;-))
[/LIST]


[B]Status:[/B]
Still in development, but ready for a Version 1.0 Release ;)

[B]Todo:[/B]
[LIST]
[*]Persist the settings
[*]Generate a ready to flash zip-file
[*]Bugfixing
[*]Creating new styles
[*]And finally....A lot of things that you might come up with ;)
[/LIST]

[B]HowTo:[/B]
This tool is written in pure Java. So the only thing you need to have is a Java Runtime 1.6 or 1.7.

[LIST]
[*]Unzip the tool in any directory
[*]Step into that directory
[*]Doubleclick in the Jar-file
