[SIZE="6"][B][CENTER]I proudly present my new Battery Icon Creator[/CENTER][/B][/SIZE]

[SIZE="4"][B]History:[/B][/SIZE]
I was fed up, with designing my battery-icons with a paint-tool. 204 icons per set is a lot work, if you do it manually!
As I mostly did abstract and simple icons to be in harmony with AOKP, I had the idea, to develop a little Java Tool to do the work for me ;)
Now it has grown up !!!

[SIZE="4"][B][CENTER]So here is: ...[/CENTER][/B][/SIZE]

[SIZE="4"][B]HowTo:[/B][/SIZE]
This tool is written in pure Java. So the only thing you need to have is a Java Runtime 1.6 or 1.7.
[LIST]
[*]Download the zip attached to this Post
[*]Unzip the tool to any directory
[*]Step into that directory
[*]Doubleclick in the Jar-file
[*]...or use the start.bat
[*]Choose Design (Combobox in Buttonbar)
[*]Choose your ROM's dpi (RR 2.7 is hdpi, RR 3.x.x is xhdpi)
[*]Create your images (Play-Button)
[*]...play with resize-option and algorithm to get best results
[*]...the Tool will create a new folder "pngs" in the above directory
[*]...find your Icons in there...
[*]Or (when you are satisfied with your settings) create a flashable Zip (Button next to Playbutton)
[*]...find the Zip in the "flashablezip_out"-folder
