[SIZE="4"][B]What is this ?[/B][/SIZE]
This tool started as a "Creator/Renderer" for battery-icon-png's. And this is still the most prominent feature in this tool!
It renders those images with algorithms, that are highly customizable! You can create almost unlimited variations of "battery icon sets"!   
It can also render "Wifi- and Signal Icon Sets" in the same way as battery icon sets. 

[URL="http://www.xda-developers.com/android/create-android-status-bar-icon-sets-with-the-rom-fumbler/"]Read the feature on XDA Portal ![/URL] (Thanks Guys for the promotion!)

[B]But this tool can do a big bunch of other things![/B]
Most usefull : It can [b]create "flashable-zip's"[/b] of the above icons!
And there are still more things it can do!!! ...so here is the "complete" feature list:

[*]Bugfixing
[*]Make the Style-Modules even more customizable
[*]Creating new styles

[/LIST]

[SIZE="4"][B]HowTo - General[/B][/SIZE]
This tool is written in pure Java. So the only thing you need to have is a Java Runtime 1.6 or 1.7.
[LIST]
[*]Download the zip('s) attached to this Post
[*]Unzip the tool to any directory
[*]Step into that directory
[*]Look around...see the ./custom/... folder? This is where you can put your own custom stuff
[*]Doubleclick in the Jar-file
... or better use the start.bat to start this tool!
[*]Choose your ROM-Preset in tab "Rom-Settings" (Default values are for Resurrection Remix 3.1.2+)
[*]Choose a Battery Design 
[*]Choose a Wifi Design 
[*]Choose a Signal Design 
[*]Choose any other stuff you want to add
[*]Play with all those different settings...
[*]Create/Refresh your images (Play-Button)
[*]If you just want the icons and no flashable-zip, then goto
... the folder "./pngs/..." in the above directory and find your Icons in there...
[*]Or (when you are satisfied with your settings) create a flashable-zip (Button next to Play-Button)
... find the flashable-zip in the "./flashablezip_out"-folder...
[/LIST]

[SIZE="4"][B]HowTo - Is my ROM supported? What Settings do I need?[/B][/SIZE]
For a Rom to be supported, it needs to have a 1% battery mod!
Samsung Stock Roms don't have this until a Mod like JKay is applied.
CM10 Roms like the official nightlies or Paranoidandroid don't have this either. 
I am sure there are some Mod's out there that will do the trick with these Roms...
(You may want to try the linked tool in Resources-Section of this post)

If your ROM has a 1% Mod, there are only a few things you need to investigate, to find the correct Settings for my tool.
You need to...
[LIST]
[*]extract the SystemUI.apk from your Rom (look in the flashabel zip of your Rom, 
[*}or use your phone and navigate with EsExplorer or Root-Explorer to /system/app and find SystemUI.apk there and 
[*]...copy it to your internal or external SD card, so you can access the file from your Computer
[*]Open SystemUI.apk with 7Zip and navigate to ...
[*]...res\drawable-<xxxx> and find the rom's original 1% battery icons in there
[*]remember the folder you found your png's in. (normally [B]drawable-hdpi or drawable-xhdpi[/B])
[*]see how the Files are named? (something like [B]stat_sys_battery_circle_charge_anim<percentage>.png[/B])
[*]check the height of the original png's
[*]now you got everything to choose the correct settings in the Battery Icon Creator
[*]...drawable-Folder
[*]...naming convention/pattern of png's
[*]...icon height
[/LIST]
If you found your settings, please let me know, what settings, what ROM you used. 
So I can add the ROM to my compatibility list and add predefined Settings to the tool itself.
