The Battery Icon Designer seems to grow up!!...By now it is much more than just an Battery-Icon-Renderer.
Need to think about a new name ?!
Now you can additionally modify many aspects of the statusbar and notification area!
But you need to know, there are 2 different approaches how this tool uses/creates icons:
[LIST]
[*]Signal, Wifi & Battery: Those are the icons that are rendered directly from this tool. 
It uses a mathmatic and graphical algorithms for that.
[*]And there are the other icons like lockring, weather and toggle-icons. 
These icons are not rendered. You can use any Icons you collected.
Just put them in the right place in the custom area of this tool. 
[B]Attention:[/B] Make sure they are correctly named to fit with the "to be replaced" icons in your ROM!! 
(To every rule there is an exception! Lockrings, can be named what ever you want...they are renamed before flash-zip creation) 
[/LIST]

The Battery Icon Creator will take all of the above icons and put them into one flashable zip!
So what you finally get is almost a "theme"!
