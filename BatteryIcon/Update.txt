[/LIST]

The tool now handles with the problem, that framework-res has other dpi than systemUI...in latest RR 3.1.2!

This means all your old Mod's are not compatible any more, when they have stuff in it that ends up in framework-res! You need to create your MOD again! (On the bright side...the old Mod's will not do any harm...they will just add pngs to framework-res, that are never read ;))

Happy modding & flashing :)
