[LIST]
[*]New Tab for custom Signal & Wifi Icons (Statusbar-Icons) like the Toggle-Tab. So these icons will be resized to fit your Rom Settings. 
Make sure you don't create Signal or Wifi-Icons with the Renderer at the same time, as this will result in a conflict when creating the flashable-zip!
[*]New predefined Signal & Wifi Icon-Sets
[*]Updated and polished 4.2 Toggle-Icon-Sets (new tiles like "hide-nav-bar", "silent hours" and so on...

Happy modding & flashing :)
