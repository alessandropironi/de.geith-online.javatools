[B][SIZE="3"]New Version out of [URL="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1918500"]"The Rom Fumbler" aka "The Battery Icon Creator"[/URL][/SIZE][/B]

Attention...as Resurrection Remix is not developed any more (at least it seems like this) I switched to Rootbox! 
And therefor all defaults are now fitting for Rootbox i9100 (hdpi)

Added predefinded custom iconsets for statusbar signal & wifi icons (based on new rootbox icons, but better readable)

[COLOR="Blue"][B]Feb-26-2013[/B] : Release 20.0[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*]New Tab for custom Signal & Wifi Icons (Statusbar-Icons) like the Toggle-Tab. So these icons will be resized to fit your Rom Settings. 
Make sure you don't create Signal or Wifi-Icons with the Renderer at the same time, as this will result in a conflict when creating the flashable-zip!
[*]New predefined Signal & Wifi Icon-Sets
[*]Updated and polished 4.2 Toggle-Icon-Sets (new tiles like "hide-nav-bar", "silent hours" and so on...)
[*]All default settings now for Rootbox i9100 (hdpi). Not xhdpi any more!!!
[/LIST]

Happy modding & flashing :)
